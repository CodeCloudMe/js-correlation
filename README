This is a javascript based script for finding the best correlation in numerical arrays of data.

For example, if we take a look at the arrays

[1,2,4]

and 

[1,-3,6]

the best correaltion is that after two intervals from the first interval, the number allways goes up.

You can use this across thousands for numbers in two separate series to find the best connection between inverse/direct relationships, how far out ("tries" or "intervals") these relationship are apart, and how consistant this connection is.

If your response is:
{offset: 2, rel: "same", correlation: 1}
Then, there is a 100% consistancy in the relationship overtime. The offset is the number of intervals between the numbers having the inverse/direct relationship. The relationship (or "rel") of the connection is "same", which means direct.

If your correlation is .85, then there is a 85% consistancy.

This can be used to find correlations and train a machine learning algorithm to make decisions based on series of data.
